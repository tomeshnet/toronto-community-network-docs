# Finances

The purpose of this document is to describe the financial status and processes of the Toronto Community Network.

## Introduction
The Toronto Community Network is a community project that current does not have its own independent legal entity or bank accounts, and relies on trustees to provide fiscal administration capacity.
Aside from out-of-pocket spendings from some of our members, our current financing comes from one single grant from the [Internet Society](https://www.internetsociety.org) administering through [Free Geek Toronto](https://www.freegeektoronto.org).

## Internet Society Grant
TBA (some information about the grant)

### Administration
Free Geek Toronto currently holds the full amount of the grant, and the balance of X (after 10% of administrative fees) is to be distributed for the project according to the budget set out in the grant proposal.
We have two-levels of approvals for fund allocations:

1. Four members of Toronto Mesh involved in the grant application are selected as Administrators, and will approve allocations according to whether an expense fits with the spirit of the grant objectives and its proposed budget.

2. Free Geek Toronto will approve allocations according to the Memorandum of Understanding, and they reserve the right to reject allocations that may put them in a position of legal liability due to violation of grant terms.

In the course of administering the grant, Administrators may draft request for proposals (RFPs) or delegate budgets to working groups to allocate as they deem necessary.
For example, the Administrators may allocate a budget for training and request for member applications, or delegate a small budget for the _Communications and Community Engagement_ working group to spend on an event as they see fit.

Hardware purchase makes up the bulk of the Internet Society grant budget.
The _Network Planning, Design and Operations_ working group will be responsible for making hardware procurement proposals using the following template, submitted as a pull request to [operations/hardware-budgets](https://github.com/tomeshnet/toronto-community-network/new/master/operations/hardware-budgets/):
