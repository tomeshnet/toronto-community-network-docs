# Legal

Toronto Mesh is a community organization [established in 2016](https://tomesh.net/timeline/), stewarded by a group of individual contributors and supported by many value-aligned organizations.
It is not an independent legal entity.

The Toronto Community Network is a project led by the Toronto Mesh community, and adopts a multi-stakeholder model to its project governance.
Since neither Toronto Mesh or the Toronto Community Network has its own independent legal entity or bank accounts, it relies on trustees to provide fiscal administration capacity.

It is necessary for Toronto Mesh or the Toronto Community Network to engage into contractual agreements to work with many institutional collaborators.
Depending on the nature of the collaboration, our [Organizational and Program Governance Working Group](./working-groups.html#organizational-and-program-governance) will designate appropriate signatories to sign the agreement on behalf of Toronto Mesh or the Toronto Community Network on a case-by-case basis.

We understand that some organizations can only work with legally registered entities.
If a contract must be made with a legal entity, we suggest a contract covering a specific project scope be made with one of our institutional collaborators.
This way, you can indirectly work with the Toronto Community Network through this institutional collaborator.
It is important to note that this contract will not bind Toronto Mesh or the Toronto Community Network as a whole, as collaborators do not individually represent the entire multi-stakeholder project.
