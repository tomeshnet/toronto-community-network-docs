# Learning Group

Toronto Community Network has established a learning group for us to develop deeper understanding about projects related to our community network.
This group meets regularly with the [Organizational and Program Governance Working Group](./working-groups.html#organizational-and-program-governance) and you can find the meeting schedule on [our calendar](https://link.tomesh.net/calendar).
